# Tip-Calculator

This app was made at Makeschool Summer Academy. 

The tip calculator consists of two UI Color themes that the user can toggle between. It allows the user to enter their bill and choose from a 15%, 18%, or 20% tip. The amount of the tip is then displayed along with their final bill including the tip.
